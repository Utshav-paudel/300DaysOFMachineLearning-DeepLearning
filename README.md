### 1. Supervised learning
Learns from being given `right answers`.  
Supervised machine learning is based on the basis of labeled data.First the data is fed to the model with both input and output and later on test data is given to make prediction by model. 
some algorithm used in supervised learning with their uses are :  
* Regression : House price prediction.
* Classification : Breast cancer detection.  
### 2. Unsupervised learning  
Learns by finding pattern in unlabelled data.
Unsupervised learning is different from supervised learning as it is not provided with labelled data.The algorithm work by finding pattern in data.  
some algorithm used in unsupevised learning with it uses are:
* Clustering : Grouping similar data points together e.g: grouping of customer , grouping of news,DNA microarray.
* Anomlay detection: Finding unusal data points e.g: fraud detection , quality check.
* Dimensionality reduction : Compress data using feweer numbers e.g : Image processing.
